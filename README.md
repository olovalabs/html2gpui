# gpui editor

Native code editor: file tree + [gpui-component](https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-component) `Input` in **code editor** mode (rope buffer, tree-sitter highlighting, search).

```
cargo run -p app
```

Starts with **no project loaded** (VS Code-style welcome screen):

- **Open Folder** — pick a folder to browse in the explorer
- **Open File** (`Ctrl+O`) — open a single file
- **New File** (`Ctrl+N`) — untitled buffer; `Ctrl+S` opens Save As
- **Ctrl+S** save · **Ctrl+F** search (from the editor library)

## Syntax highlighting — Zed's exact palette

Default theme: **GitHub Dark** (from
[PyaeSoneAungRgn/github-zed-theme](https://github.com/PyaeSoneAungRgn/github-zed-theme)),
plus Ayu and Gruvbox families. The JSONs in `app/assets/themes/` are verbatim
Zed theme files consumed two ways:

1. UI chrome colors → `src/theme/colors.rs` tokens
2. the full `syntax` token table (46 entries) + editor colors → forwarded
   untouched into gpui-component's `HighlightTheme`, whose schema is
   explicitly Zed-compatible. Tree-sitter captures (`keyword`, `function`,
   `comment.doc`, …) are painted with exactly Zed's colors; switching themes
   via **View → Theme** re-skins chrome *and* syntax together.

## Language servers

Errors, warnings, completions, hover, go-to-definition and quick fixes are
live, and the Node-based servers **install themselves on first use** — no
`npm i -g`, no PATH setup. The design follows Zed's, split the same three ways:

| Zed | here | responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `crates/node_runtime` | `src/lsp/node.rs` | find Node, `npm install` servers on demand |
| `crates/languages` (`LspAdapter` impls) | `src/lsp/adapter.rs` | per-server binary, init options, settings, language ids |
| `crates/lsp`, `crates/project/src/lsp_store.rs` | `src/lsp/client.rs` | JSON-RPC transport, document sync, diagnostics, providers |

Open `App.tsx` in a project with nothing installed and you get:

1. `lang.rs` → `tsx` → the `typescript-language-server` adapter.
2. Nothing installed, so a background `npm install typescript-language-server
   typescript@6` runs into a **private** container dir
   (`~/.local/share/olova-editor/language-servers/<server>`, mirroring Zed's
   `~/.local/share/zed/languages/`) — never a global prefix, never your
   project. The status bar shows `◌ installing…`.
3. Install finishes → the server starts and every already-open buffer it
   handles is attached, so you don't have to reopen the file you're looking at.
4. `initialize` → the client answers the server's `workspace/configuration`
   request from the adapter → diagnostics start flowing.
5. A version marker makes every later launch instant and offline-clean.

Auto-installed (Node): `typescript-language-server` (ts/js/tsx/jsx, one
process for all four so imports resolve across files), `vscode-css-language-server`,
`vscode-html-language-server`, `json-language-server`, `yaml-language-server`,
`bash-language-server`, `docker-langserver`.
Looked up on PATH (toolchain-owned): rust-analyzer, gopls, basedpyright,
clangd, zls, lua-language-server, taplo, intelephense, ruby-lsp.

### Two things that are easy to get wrong

Both were verified against the real servers rather than assumed:

* **`workspace/configuration` must be answered.** The VS Code-derived servers
  ask for their settings right after `initialized` and publish *nothing* until
  they get a reply. Replying `-32601` (the obvious "we implement no server
  requests" default) yields **0 diagnostics for CSS and HTML** while
  TypeScript still works — which is exactly the "works for some languages, not
  others" symptom. Answering with the adapter's config blob takes both from
  0 → 2 diagnostics on a broken fixture. This is why
  `capabilities.workspace.configuration = true` and `handle_server_request`
  exist.
* **Request ids are `integer | string`.** A client that only parses integer
  ids silently drops string-id requests and deadlocks the servers that use
  them.

Note that `vscode-html-language-server` validates *embedded* CSS/JS rather
than HTML tag nesting — it does not flag an unclosed `<div>`, matching VS Code.

## Fonts — Zed's shipped set

`app/assets/fonts/` contains the exact TTFs Zed ships: **IBM Plex Sans**
(UI, 4 styles) and **Lilex** (code buffer, 4 styles), with their licenses
(`LICENSE-IBMPlex.txt`, `LICENSE-Lilex-OFL.txt`). At startup every embedded
TTF is registered with GPUI's text system (`load_embedded_fonts`, mirroring
Zed's approach); the widget library is then pointed at them
(`mono_font_family = Lilex` for the editor, `font_family = IBM Plex Sans`
for UI) and re-applied after every theme switch.

## File icons

Explorer icons come from Zed's default icon theme — SVGs in
`app/assets/file_icons/` and the extension→icon tables in `src/file_icons.rs`,
ported from Zed's `crates/theme/src/icon_theme.rs`. Unknown extensions fall
back to Zed's default file icon. Activity-bar glyphs are Zed's own icons
(`app/assets/ui_icons/`).

Note: colorful file/folder icons are rendered with `gpui::img()` because
gpui's `svg()` element paints a single tint color; UI glyphs intentionally use
tinted `svg()` so they follow the theme.
